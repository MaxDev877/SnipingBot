# Arbitrage Trading Bot

## Overview

Welcome to the **Arbitrage Trading Bot** repository! This project is designed to automate arbitrage trading between two popular decentralized exchanges, **Uniswap** and **Sushiswap**. 
The main component of this project is the `SnipingBot.sol`, which serves as the core arbitrage bot. The PDM and GPM are optional, but they can be very helpful when deploying the contract.

In addition to the arbitrage bot, the project includes two essential monitoring tools:
- **Price Discrepancy Monitor (PDM)**: Monitors price differences between Uniswap and Sushiswap, alerting users to potential arbitrage opportunities.
- **Gas Price Monitor (GPM)**: Tracks Ethereum gas prices and notifies users when prices are low enough for cost-effective trading.

All components are designed to run seamlessly using **MetaMask** with **Remix**, making it easy for users to deploy and interact with the smart contracts.

## Features

- **Automated Arbitrage**: Executes trades automatically based on price discrepancies between Uniswap and Sushiswap.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks price discrepancies and gas prices to optimize trading strategies.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed to work with MetaMask and Remix, ensuring a smooth user experience for Ethereum traders.

## Experimental Status

Please note that this project is EXPERIMENTAL and you CAN LOSE YOUR BALANCE. Users should proceed with caution and perform their own research before deploying any contracts or running the monitoring tools.

## Installation & Usage
